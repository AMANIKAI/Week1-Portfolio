 <h3>My Background</h3>
 <p #p1>My name is Amani Kai. I am from Kilifi. I am 41years old. I started my education at Katikirieni primary school in Kilifi south, joined St. George's High school in Kaloleni Giriama where I completed my KCSE. I persued a Diploma course at the then Mombasa Polytechnic which is the present Technical University of Mombasa and later persued a Bachelor of Commerce, Finance at MKU.</p>
 <p #p2>I like adventure and sightseeing. Having spent my childhood and early adult life at the Coast, I like to stroll along the beautiful beaches at the Coast and basking in the sunshine while enjoying the cool ocean breeze.</p>
 <p #p3>I was first employed at Uchumi Supermarkets as a sales agent for Carpers and floor mats section, later at KenCall BPO Limited as a Customer care agent and in January 2012 I joined Safaricom Jambo Contact Center as a Customer Experience Executive. I moved later from Call Center to Retail where I am currently at Burburu Retail Shop. </p>
